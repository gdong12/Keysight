# Keysight
A repository for Keysight job application files.

The repository should consist of 3 zip files of different projects.  The coding challenge is in vending_machine - George Dong.zip and is done in python. The other two files consist of C++ coursework done in an undergraduate ECE course at Georgia Tech. They are both designed to be used with an Mbed device. WavePlayer_HelloWorld_full - George Dong.zip is a music player that stores songs and outputs them to be played on a speaker.  mymbedthermostat_uvision_lpc1768 - George Dong.zip emulates a thermostat.  Most of the work done by this author in those files is in the respective main.cpp files.

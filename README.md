# Keysight
A repository for Keysight job application files.

The repository should consist of 3 folders of different projects.  The coding challenge is in vending_machine and is done in python. The other two files consist of C++ coursework done in an undergraduate ECE course at Georgia Tech. They are both designed to be used with an Mbed device. WavePlayer_HelloWorld_full is a music player that stores songs and outputs them to be played on a speaker.  mymbedthermostat_uvision_lpc1768 emulates a thermostat.  Most of the work done by this author in those files is in the respective main.cpp files.

Also contained at zip versions of the folders, just in case.
